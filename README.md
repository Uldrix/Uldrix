<p><b>Welcome to My Profile, and Thank You for Your Interest!</b></p>

<p>You may notice low activity on my GitHub accountâ€”that's because I host all my projects on a private GitLab instance.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m an ICT, cybersecurity, OSINT, and gaming enthusiast with a lifelong passion for technology.</p>

<p>My journey started at the age of 8 when I got my hands on a Commodore 64. If youâ€™ve ever used one, you know what an exciting piece of tech it was! ðŸ˜Š<br>
Over the years, Iâ€™ve explored and enjoyed other classics like the Amiga 500, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, and Macintosh.</p>

<p>
âš¡<b>My Early Adventures in Coding</b><br>
I started coding on the Commodore 64 using BASIC and its proprietary assembly language. I even had an MK Replay cartridge that allowed me to hack games and the Commodore hardware, enabling infinite lives, unlimited ammo, and more!
</p>

<p>
When PCs entered the scene, my first machine was an 8086 running at 2 MHz, with a "turbo" boost to 4 MHz, 640 KB of memory, and a 10 MB hard drive. It was an epic leap in technology for me at the time.
</p>

<p>
This is when I began learning C and x86 assembly language. I enjoyed replicating well-known system tools for fun and learning. One fun project was coding a utility entirely in x86 assembly that stands in a memory segment and that i made start at the boot of the computer acting like an operation system.
</p>

<p>
Later, I ventured into Turbo Pascal and C++, dabbling in game development. Although I lost the source code for those early projects, I continued experimenting with frameworks like DarkBasic, which made game creation fun and accessible. (Yes, DarkBasic is still around for memories!)
</p>

<p>
âš¡<b>Broad Programming Experience</b><br>
Over the years, Iâ€™ve acquired the ability to quickly learn new programming languages and frameworks. My experience includes:
</p>
<p>
Languages: COBOL, WinDev, PowerBuilder, Visual Basic, Python, JavaScript, PHP, Node.js, and Electron.<br>
Databases: Proficient in SQL, Iâ€™ve worked with Sybase and now primarily use MySQL/MariaDB for my projects.<br>
CMS Platforms: Familiar with Joomla, WordPress, and PrestaShop.<br>
Web: HTML, CSS, JS</p>

<p>
âš¡<b>Current Focus and Expertise</b><br>
Today, I work across Linux, macOS, and Windows, with advanced skills in Linux administration. 
</p>

<p>
âš¡<b>Networking</b><br>
LAN, VLAN, SSH, FTP, SFTP, TCP/IP, UDP, OSI, SSL, WIFI, host, vhost, routers, switches, etc.
</p>

<p>
âš¡<b>AI forever</b><br>
Iâ€™m an avid AI enthusiast, regularly using tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Copilot, and Gemini for productivity, along with image generation tools like DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Flux, and ComfyUI (mostly running local instances).
</p>

  <p>
âš¡<b>Virtualization</b><br>
I have practical experience with virtualization platforms, including VirtualBox, Parallels, VMware, and Proxmox, which I use for lab setups.
</p>

<p>
âš¡<b>Interests in Robotics</b><br>
While Iâ€™m fascinated by robotics and virtual reality, my time is limited to dabbling in these areas. However i own a NAO robot v4.
</p>

<p>
âš¡<b>Cybersecurity</b><br>
Cybersecurity, however, remains a passion. Iâ€™m comfortable with tools like Kali Linux, Whonix, Tor, HackTheBox (CTF), and dark web exploration. Iâ€™m currently developing an OSINT platform in Node.js and MySQL, which is in the alpha stage.
</p>

<p>
âš¡<b>Gaming and Game Development</b><br>
As a gamer, I enjoy World of Warcraft, Starfield, and Second Life. I also love creating games. My development journey includes:
</p>

<p>
Learning Unity3D and a bit of Unreal Engine.<br>
Experimenting with Blender, although I havenâ€™t had time to fully develop my skills.<br>
Developing a 2D MMORPG using C++ and the SDL2 framework.<br>
Iâ€™m building both the client and server, leveraging the BOOST library for networking and implementing multi-layer encryption with dynamic public/private keys for secure communication.<br>
I can also deploy local instances of OpenSim, the open-source version of Second Life.
</p>

<p>
âš¡<b>Future Goals</b><br>
Iâ€™m planning to pursue academic qualifications in network security and cybersecurity through evening courses. Iâ€™m actively seeking a company that can offer me a positionâ€”such as system administration, DevOps, or SecOpsâ€”while I complete my studies.
